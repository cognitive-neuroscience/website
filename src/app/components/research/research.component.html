        Is apathy related to an inability to effectively deploy cognitive effort? 
        Or does it relate to an inability to evaluate and compare outcomes? Do Parkinson’s patients 
        lose the ability to prioritize information for processing? Does this relate to dopamine-dependent 
        reward signalling? We aim to leverage advances in cognitive neuroscience to identify specific mechanisms 
        of behavioural and cognitive deficits in patients.

        Cognitive symptoms in Parkinson’s and Huntington’s disease represent one of the greatest unmet needs. 
        We need solutions. We aim to understand how modifiable factors like sleep, stress, and dopamine 
        replacement affect cognitive processes and how simple behavioural interventions could also help.

        Cognitive and behavioural symptoms vary immensely from one person to the next. Some patients 
        develop significant apathy or difficulty multi-tasking, others take up boxing or plan local support 
        groups. This variability may represent important clues. In order to account for it in our research we 
        need to find new ways of evaluating cognition in patients and we need to test large representative 
        samples. We aim to develop an accessible platform for testing that relies on quantitative, 
        neurobiologically-grounded approaches to testing cognition.
