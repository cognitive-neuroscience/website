Currently, he is trying to understand the mechanisms driving well-known cognitive deficits in Parkinson's disease patients, such as attention and working memory, and how they may be linked to the underlying dopamine pathology."

            "bio": "Sophie is interested in the brain-behaviour relationships that affect cognitive impairment in prodromal Parkinson's Disease (PD). Dopamine and noradrenaline are important modulators of cognition and also among the first neuronal systems to degenerate in PD. For her thesis, she is studying the behavioural outputs of reward learning and attention - cognitive processes that have been reliably linked to the dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems, respectively - in prodromal PD patients. Understanding of the mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment during this early period is crucial because neurodegeneration remains relatively contained, therefore we can establish clearer brain-behaviour relationships."

            "bio": "Soraya is interested in the process of memory consolidation (i.e., the strengthening of a memory over time) and how this interacts with sleep and dopamine in Parkinson's disease patients. Both sleep and dopamine are important for consolidation, yet little is known about how these two interact and affect the consolidation process in PD patients. In addition to the dopamine deficits, patients often struggle with a number of sleep-related symptoms. Impairments in the consolidation process might be a mechanism that underlies the cognitive and executive impairments present in patients."

She plans to eventually pursue a degree in clinical neuropsychology."
